The vsss speech shell
--------------------

    vsss is a script for controlling a software speech synthesizer such as espeak or swift. These programs have characteristics that make
    it nearly impossible to control from a modern terminal emulator. There are of course Graphical User Interfaces to such software -
    however are all stink, or haven't been updated since the days when OSS was still current. This script is designed to be used -
    with a dumb terminal emulator such as 9term or xterm, smarter TMs  (Gnome terminal, KConsole, etc) will not work as they have -
    more complicated interrupt handling, and input buffering. 

    The launcher I've written for the command interpreter depends on Plan 9 User Space currently see http://swtch.com/plan9port/ but should be easy to modify if -
    you don't want the plan9 user space, although I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't :) At any rate once you -
    have p9p installed or if you're self loathing is so intense that you have decided to remove all the fun bits.
    Such as non mono-space fonts and less sucky handling of Unicode
    On launching the script you will be greeted by the friendliest user interface in the history of the world to wit. Or maybe an error see below for details.


		Very Stupid Speech Shell
                Version 0.2


                :
    The colon tells you that the program is waiting for commands which for your convince are a maximum of two letters long

    Command:            WTF?
    s|ss                Snarf 'n' say copy clipboard text to a new snarf buffer, speak snarf buffer
    m                   Mangle: start a sub shell
    e                   starts an editor on the current snarf buffer 
    r                   speak active snarf buffer
    l                   load clipboard text into the active snarf buffer
    b                   recall the contents of the last snarf buffer after s|l|c
    sc                  clear the screen leaving snarf buffers intact
    c                   clear the active snarf buffer
    n                   Nuke: Clear all active and non-active buffers from the session
    q or Q              quit




There will sometimes be an error in 9term's initdraw and it will complain about
the directory /tmp/9fnt to fix do kill $(pgrep fontsrv); fontsrv -m /tmp/9fnt &
This is somehow related to how the 9p protocol and FUSE interact and i will fix it sometime in the near future
