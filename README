vsss: A Very Simple Speech Shell
================================

    vsss is a script for controlling a software speech synthesizer such as espeak or swift. These programs have characteristics that make
    it nearly impossible to control from a modern terminal emulator. There are of course Graphical User Interfaces to such software -
    however are all stink, or haven't been updated since the days when OSS was still current. This script is designed to be used -
    with a dumb terminal emulator such as 9term or xterm, smarter TMs  (Gnome terminal, KConsole, etc) will not work as they have -
    more complicated interrupt handling, and input buffering. 

    vsss depends on the Plan 9 User Space currently see http://swtch.com/plan9port/ but should be easy to modify if -
    you don't want the plan9 user space, although I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't :) At any rate once you -
    have p9p installed or if you're self loathing is so intense that you have decided to remove all the fun bits.
    and you launch the script you will be greeted by the friendliest user interface in the history of the world to wit

                :
    The colon tells you that the program is waiting for commands which for your convince are a maximum of two letters long

    Command:            WTF?
    s|ss                Snarf 'n' say copy clipboard text to a new snarf buffer, speak snarf buffer
    m                   Mangle: start a sub shell
    e                   starts an editor on the current snarf buffer 
    r                   speak active snarf buffer
    l                   load clipboard text into the active snarf buffer
    b                   recall the contents of the last snarf buffer after s|l|c
    sc                  clear the screen leaving snarf buffers intact
    c                   clear the active snarf buffer
    n                   Nuke: Clear all active and non-active buffers from the session
